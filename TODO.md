# TODO
 - IPC/tip bot
 - track + log warns (if a mod replies to a user and then within 1 minute afterward deletes a message from that user with timestamp prior to that mention, or if a mod deletes a message by a user within +/- 1 minute of pinging that user (NOT A REPLY, MUST BE A DIRECT PING))
 - track + log mutes + mute notification message in-place
 - add unban command
