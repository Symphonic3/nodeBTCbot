  "quantum": "A general purpose and stable high qubit quantum computer (which doesn't exist and no one is sure if will ever exist) can run an algorithm called shor's. Shor's is used to factor numbers.  You can thus use shor's to derive a private key from a public key. Bitcoin exposes public keys in the scenarios of certain address reuse and when certain transactions are sitting in the mempool, as well as very old 2009 era pay to pubkey coinbases and new taproot transactions. What will happen if such a computer ever exists is slowly attempts to mine the most static of these coins, probably the old coinbases, will occur. Once this happens everyone will know there is a quantum actor and avoid address reuse or in the worst case just move to a new address format. It's also important to remember that a quantum attack takes considerable time, not dissimilar to mining, as it's the process for searching for a private key. Another Algorithm, called grovers, will enable a new kind of mining ASIC, similar to how generations of PoW devices have always functioned.",

You own an IOU, which can and WILL screw you over, like has happened many times before in the cases of Mt. Gox, FTX, and the like.

This scales with factors like if people know you hold bitcoin, if you're at risk for physical attacks, etc. but for most people, it mainly depends on how *much* bitcoin you hold, and what you plan to do with it. For small amounts you want readily available for spending, a hot wallet on an internet-connected device is often the most convenient-- but this also puts you at risk of being hacked. For large amounts you really can't afford to lose, an airgapped hardware wallet is often a better choice. In some cases, you might even want to setup multisig or more complex security systems.",
  "airgap": "An airgap describes a security system where your bitcoin keys are generated and stored on a device that has never been connected to the internet, and never will be. You will usually use such a device with an app on a phone or computer which allows you to construct a transaction, move it to the device, sign it on the device, and move it back to the app in order to broadcast it. This is often done by communicating to the device through an SD card or QR codes. An airgapped device is never *connected* wirelessly or with a wire, this would break the airgap. When done properly, an airgap protects you from *most* forms of hacking. You can DIY such a system, or get a suitable hardware wallet that supports it. See `!wallet airgap`.",

With the short-term thinking of trying to time your buys to the market, you're never going to get anywhere. There's no free money to be made.

Buying bitcoin this way allows you to average in to the market, isolating the average price your bitcoin is bought at from short-term volatility in the price. When DCAing, you should choose an amount that you're capable of sustaining for however long you plan to DCA. It's always okay to adjust later if you find you're putting too much in, or if would like to put in more. The most important thing is never investing more than you can afford to lose.

Without society, money becomes fairly useless. If you have the outlook that the end of the world is where we're headed, you might as well spend all your money prepping, as almost no form of investment will help.

  "dust": "Dusting is a deanonymizing technique to try to associate random addresses to a single wallet. An attacker will add a small amount of funds to old addresses. Eventually, the wallet owner may accidentally spend from these old addresses, along with current ones, when they sweep their wallet out. This makes it somewhat evident that these addresses are owned by the same person. Even in the case where an address has a large balance, dusting can have the same effect if the owner is still spending from the wallet, but was just using coin control to exclude those large utxos. Even so, the easiest way to protect oneself from dusting attacks is by using coin control properly.",

Now who's the one who looks like an idiot? Sounds smart, right? Real technical. Odds, percentages, logic. Except it’s totally wrong. He butchered the numbers. And what’s wild is a whole YouTuber parroted it, like it was gospel. That’s what happens when you don’t verify. When you let the surface-level math sound right, but never dig deeper. That’s the same trap people fall into with shitcoins. “Oh, it has a fixed supply.” “Oh, it uses math too.” “Oh, it’s faster than Bitcoin.” Cool story. Show me the code. Show me the decentralization. Show me the uptime, the hash power, the node count. Most of these projects are casinos dressed up like science. Math isn't just a buzzword—it’s the firewall.
